    "## On Process Philosophy in Biology\n",
    "### [Chapter 1 - (A Manifesto for a Processual Philosophy of Biology) by John Dupré and Daniel Nicholson](https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198779636.003.0001)\n",

    "A good chunk of biology can be said to be developed under substance metaphysics rather than under process metaphysics. Although there are some exceptions with some attention being pulled to processual biology within the last century, and a bigger pull of attention happening more recently, substance metaphysics has been named king, where reality is seen as being composed by things rather than processes or events, if one takes the processual approach. Fundamentally, a merger of these two (if not actually of a bigger amount of approaches) is necessary to have a better understanding of the biological world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Biological systems can be taken as hierarchies of processes. There would not be a fundamental level of causation, for example refering to the relationships between cells, tissues, organism, social network, etc. There's both top-down and bottom-up causation, and we shouldn't prioritize any of these over others. Things, for example when refering to a specific cell of a certain type with certain characteristics, can be seen merely as conditional abstractions of the processes they \"compose\". Processes are the fundamental entity. There's no type of dualism (things/processes) to be discussed, given that things are derived from processes, and not the other way around (Atleast when refering to process metaphysics. One can take a multi-perspective approach, as mentioned before, and take the best out of substance and process metaphysics.).\n",

    "#### On some organicists' views (namely Paul Alfred Weiss')\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that life can be viewed as a dynamic process, an organism or a biological system shouldn't be decomposed into elementary <em>things</em> but rather in elementary <em>processes</em>. As such, a better understanding of a cell doesn't derive from a better understanding of its components inasmuch as a better understanding of how the relationships between these evolve over time (Although, as is evident, the quantification of some components is often useful as a proxy for the evolution of said relationships).

    "# Church–Turing–Deutsch principle (strong Church–Turing thesis) and other related things\n",
    "\n",
    "There's an increasing tendency to consider said principle as something viable. The resulting view is that of pancomputationalism. As such, every type of physical process ought to be Turing-computable. The consequence of this, is that everything is algorithmic computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the biggest problems of taking this principle as something completely definite, is that largely it only concerns itself with syntax (computation), without any aid of semantics or the inherent meaning with the signs or symbols, or any of their relations. As such, semiotics is missing. All of this to say, that any of the things we've built are still very much away from anything that resembles an organism.\n",
    "\n",
    "The major difference between organisms and any of the machines we've built, is that they (organisms) both build themselves from scratch and solve problems of relevance. Solving problems of relevance is particularly important given that they need to make more concrete \"ill-defined\" problems. Given their limitedness and associated resource scarcity, they need to make clear what's important, within themselves and their environment. Albeit, this is probably a \"given\" by autopoiesis and the their capacity to build themselves. We can still refer to other approaches to embodied cognition that are gaining some prominence today, but these systems still are very much away from building themselves. This might be because they lack organisational closure. In this case, systems that show organisational closure, are thermodynamically far-from-equilibrium systems, in which their organisation is built around a set of processes that hold a dialectial relation. That is, the processes co-create each other and can't exist independently of each other. This is impredicativity, which is stronger than recursion. Such system (with this organisation) is constituent-agnostic, but its organisation is kept by the constant renewall of constraints, that modulate the respective processes, and these leading to new constraints."
